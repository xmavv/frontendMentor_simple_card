### Deploying project

- Here is live server ==> https://stylecard-xmavv.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Finally learned how to center items correctly (height: 100vh at the body tag :D)

Tricky one was with the hover animation on main image, I needed to reasearch and give it some time

Images have their's own display: inline-block, and in this case I had to change it to block, in case to cover all image with my cyan bg color

### Useful resources
